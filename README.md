# PowerCLI
Automation With PowerCLI for VMware Virtual Datacenter

# This project configures NFS and iSCSI on a Windows Server via Powershell, then with PowerCLI deploys ESXi hosts from a CSV file into vCenter, and assign them appropriate VMNICs and configures their VMKernels, adds PortGroup and assigns them IP addresses, and then configures NFS, iSCSI, and vSAN storage to the deployed ESXi hosts without any user intervention.
